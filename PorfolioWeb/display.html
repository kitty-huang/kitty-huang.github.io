        <h4> Why are we still dealing with females being viewed as objects displayed for window-shopping? By using framing wood, I was able to create an environment of a store-front window by employing cable wires that are attached to strategic locations on the garment. After searching for suitable locations, I finally found the back alley of a See’s Candies store. My hope is for the viewers to realize women are not just “for display purposes only”.
