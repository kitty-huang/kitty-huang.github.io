    <h1>
      “In Defense of the Poor Image”
    </h1>

    <div class="box">

        Steyerl had an interesting take on the values, social construct, and meanings of poor images. He compared the poor image to “a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed for free, squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied and pasted into their channels of distribution”. He believes that the poor image is a form of abstraction, a “visual idea in its very becoming”. When talking about low resolution images, Steyerl used one of Woody Allen’s film as an example, in which the main character is out of focus. He then elaborates on the idea of how focus is identified as a class position, of ease and privilege, while being out of focus lowers one’s values as an image. This resonated with my own experiences, because when I go online to look for images, I always sets the “size” of the image to “large” so that I can look for high-resolution images. Moreover, when pictures are being taken, I’ve always deemed the images with objects or people that are out of focus as subpar, unqualified, and in general, bad. The reason for the marginalization of poor images, claimed by Steyerl, was due to neoliberal radicalization of the concept of culture as commodity, which resulted in the disappearance of resistant or non-conformist visual matter. However, I believe that this was a natural phenomenon that occurred due to the change in technology and the shift of social conception of media. I don’t necessarily believe that poor images are oppressed (even though I agree with all the values and representation revealed by poor images); instead, I think it’s a change that the society had to adapt to in this mass media and mass consumption age.
